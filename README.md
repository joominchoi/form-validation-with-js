# The Odin Project: Form Validation with JavaScript

Building a browser form which collects Email, Country, Zip Code, Password and Password Confirmation fields.
- Use inline validation to inform the user whether a field is properly filled in or not
- Highlight field red and provide a helpful error message until it has been filled in properly
- Give an error message if the submit button is pushed with any active errors or unfilled required fields
- Give user a high five if all is well and the form is "submitted"
